# Progress

## What Works
- Project initialization and basic structure setup
- Core UI components (Button, Card, Input, StatusMessage)
- Service infrastructure with interfaces and factory pattern
- Memory Bank documentation established with comprehensive project information
- Initial implementation of key services:
  - Logger for consistent logging
  - ThemeDetector for adapting to website themes
  - DOMObserver for monitoring page changes
  - Initial PostDetector for identifying content

## What's Left to Build
- Complete post detection logic with robust heuristics
- Finish comment display UI with proper styling and theming
- Implement comment field enhancement with proper integration
- Set up comment storage and retrieval mechanisms
- Implement message passing between content and background scripts
- Create options page for user configuration
- Build popup UI for quick access to extension features
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Implement unit and integration tests

## Current Status
The project is in active development with the basic infrastructure in place. We're currently focusing on implementing the core functionality for post detection and comment UI integration.

## Known Issues
- Post detection may need refinement to work reliably across different website structures
- Theme detection needs improvement to handle various website designs
- Integration with dynamically loaded content requires additional work
- Performance optimization needed to minimize impact on page load
