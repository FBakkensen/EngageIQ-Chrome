# Progress

## What Works
- Project initialization with TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS
- Basic infrastructure including background scripts, content scripts, and message passing
- Options page for API key management with secure storage
- Popup UI with status information
- LinkedIn integration with post detection and comment field detection
- "Generate Comment" button UI that appears when comment field is focused
- Post content extraction for different types of LinkedIn posts
- Gemini API integration for comment generation
- Comment generation logic with different tones
- Comment display UI with various tone options
- Comment insertion into LinkedIn's editor
- Length customization for generated comments (short, medium, long)
- UI/UX improvements including:
  - Loading spinners for visual feedback
  - Floating popup with drag-and-drop functionality
  - Icon-based buttons for cleaner interface
  - Enhanced comment formatting for better readability
- Image content processing functionality (partial):
  - ✅ Image detection and extraction from LinkedIn posts (Sub-Step 18.1)
  - ✅ API integration for image processing with Gemini API (Sub-Step 18.2)
  - ✅ Advanced prompt engineering for different image types (Sub-Step 18.3)

## What's Left to Build
- Image content processing functionality (Step 18)
  - ❌ UI updates for image processing feedback (Sub-Step 18.4 - in progress)
- Code refactoring according to SOLID principles (Step 17)
  - ❌ Service analysis and planning (Sub-Step 17.1)
  - ❌ Establish test infrastructure (Sub-Step 17.2)
  - ❌ Refactor core services (Sub-Step 17.3)
  - ❌ Refactor UI components (Sub-Step 17.4)
  - ❌ Enhance dependency management (Sub-Step 17.5)
- Enhanced error handling with user-friendly messages (Step 19)
- Performance optimizations for smoother experience (Step 20)
- Final visual polish and feedback mechanisms (Step 21)
- Extensibility framework for future features (Step 22)
- End-to-end testing and packaging for Chrome Web Store (Step 23)

## Current Status
The project has implemented all core functionality for the LinkedIn comment generation feature. We've completed Steps 1-16 and Sub-Steps 18.1-18.3 of the development plan, including project setup, LinkedIn integration, AI integration, and initial UI/UX improvements. We're currently working on implementing UI updates for image processing feedback (Sub-Step 18.4). In parallel, we're planning to start the SOLID principles refactoring work (Step 17) to improve code maintainability and extensibility.

## Known Issues
- Image processing UI feedback not yet implemented
- Need UI elements to indicate which images are being analyzed
- Loading indicators for image processing operations required
- Error handling for image-specific processing failures needed
- Performance optimization for image processing on slower connections
- Compatibility testing required for image processing UI in both light/dark modes
- Need to ensure new image processing features don't disrupt existing functionality
- Code structure needs refactoring to better adhere to SOLID principles
- Test infrastructure for core services needs to be established
