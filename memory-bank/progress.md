## Current Status
The project has implemented all core functionality for the LinkedIn comment generation feature. We've completed steps 1-16 of the development plan, including project setup, LinkedIn integration, AI integration, and initial UI/UX improvements. We're now moving into Phase 4 (Robustness & Polish) with a focus on Image Content Processing (Step 17).

## Known Issues
- Image detection and processing not yet implemented
- Error handling needs improvement for robustness
- Performance optimizations required for smoother experience on slower devices
- Some UI elements may need additional polish for a fully professional appearance
- Testing across different LinkedIn page types and scenarios needed
