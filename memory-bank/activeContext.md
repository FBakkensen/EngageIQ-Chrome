# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on implementing and enhancing the EngageIQ Chrome Extension for LinkedIn:
- Completing the implementation of image content processing for AI-generated comments (currently at step 17.4)
- Enhancing error handling and robustness
- Optimizing performance to ensure smooth user experience
- Polishing UI/UX for a professional and intuitive interaction

## Recent Changes
- Implemented core functionality for LinkedIn integration
- Created comprehensive comment generation with Gemini API
- Added UI for displaying generated comments with different tones and lengths
- Enhanced comment formatting for better readability
- Implemented floating popup design with drag-and-drop functionality
- Replaced text buttons with icon images for a cleaner interface
- Added loading spinners and visual feedback for user actions
- Implemented specialized prompt engineering for image context with different image types

## Next Steps
1. **Image Content Processing** (Step 17):
   - ✅ Implement image detection and extraction from LinkedIn posts
   - ✅ Update API integration to handle image data in requests
   - ✅ Enhance prompt engineering to incorporate image context
   - ❌ Create UI updates for image processing feedback (current focus - Step 17.4)

2. **Error Handling Enhancement** (Step 18):
   - Implement comprehensive error handling for all operations
   - Add user-friendly error messages
   - Create fallback mechanisms for common failure scenarios

3. **Performance Optimization** (Step 19):
   - Add debouncing for event listeners
   - Optimize DOM operations
   - Implement resource cleanup for better memory management

4. **Finalization and Polish** (Steps 20-22):
   - Refine UI animations and transitions
   - Add extensibility for future features
   - Prepare for Chrome Web Store submission
   - Complete end-to-end testing across different scenarios

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Image Processing UI Feedback**: Designing clear visual indicators for when image content is being processed
- **UI Components for Image Analysis**: Creating visual cues to show which images are included in the analysis
- **Loading States for Image Processing**: Implementing specific loading indicators for image processing operations
- **Error Handling for Image Processing**: Developing specialized error messages for image-specific processing failures
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring responsive UI during potentially longer image processing operations
- **Compatibility Testing**: Verifying the image processing UI works consistently across light and dark modes
- **Feature Integration**: Ensuring new image processing UI doesn't disrupt existing functionality
