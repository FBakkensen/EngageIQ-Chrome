# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on implementing and enhancing the EngageIQ Chrome Extension for LinkedIn:
- Completing the implementation of image content processing for AI-generated comments (currently at step 18.4)
- Implementing code refactoring according to SOLID principles (continuing with Step 17)
- Enhancing error handling and robustness
- Optimizing performance to ensure smooth user experience
- Polishing UI/UX for a professional and intuitive interaction

## Recent Changes
- Implemented core functionality for LinkedIn integration
- Created comprehensive comment generation with Gemini API
- Added UI for displaying generated comments with different tones and lengths
- Enhanced comment formatting for better readability
- Implemented floating popup design with drag-and-drop functionality
- Replaced text buttons with icon images for a cleaner interface
- Added loading spinners and visual feedback for user actions
- Implemented image detection and extraction from LinkedIn posts
- Updated API integration to handle image data in requests
- Enhanced prompt engineering to incorporate image context
- Completed service analysis and planning for SOLID principles refactoring

## Next Steps
1. **Image Content Processing** (Step 18):
   - ✅ Sub-Step 18.1: Image Detection and Extraction
   - ✅ Sub-Step 18.2: API Integration for Image Processing
   - ✅ Sub-Step 18.3: Prompt Engineering for Image Context
   - ❌ Sub-Step 18.4: UI Updates and Testing for Image Processing (current focus)

2. **Code Refactoring According to SOLID Principles** (Step 17):
   - ✅ Sub-Step 17.1: Service Analysis and Planning
   - ❌ Sub-Step 17.2: Establish Test Infrastructure
   - ❌ Sub-Step 17.3: Enhance ServiceFactory for Dependency Management
   - ❌ Sub-Step 17.4: Refactor CommentGenerationService
   - ❌ Sub-Step 17.5: Refactor UI Components with Service-Like Behavior
   
3. **Error Handling Enhancement** (Step 19):
   - Implement comprehensive error handling for all operations
   - Add user-friendly error messages
   - Create fallback mechanisms for common failure scenarios

4. **Performance Optimization** (Step 20):
   - Add debouncing for event listeners
   - Optimize DOM operations
   - Implement resource cleanup for better memory management

5. **Finalization and Polish** (Steps 21-23):
   - Refine UI animations and transitions
   - Add extensibility for future features
   - Prepare for Chrome Web Store submission
   - Complete end-to-end testing across different scenarios

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Image Processing UI Feedback**: Designing clear visual indicators for when image content is being processed
- **UI Components for Image Analysis**: Creating visual cues to show which images are included in the analysis
- **Loading States for Image Processing**: Implementing specific loading indicators for image processing operations
- **Error Handling for Image Processing**: Developing specialized error messages for image-specific processing failures
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring responsive UI during potentially longer image processing operations
- **Compatibility Testing**: Verifying the image processing UI works consistently across light and dark modes
- **Feature Integration**: Ensuring new image processing UI doesn't disrupt existing functionality
- **SOLID Refactoring Strategy**: Determining whether to complete image processing features first (Step 18) before starting SOLID refactoring (Step 17), or work on them in parallel
