# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on developing the core functionality of the EngageIQ Chrome extension:
- Implementing the content detection system to identify appropriate places to inject comments
- Creating the UI components for the comment display and input
- Setting up the service infrastructure for the extension

## Recent Changes
- Established the memory bank with comprehensive documentation
- Set up the basic project structure with TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS
- Created initial UI components (Button, Card, Input, StatusMessage)
- Implemented service interfaces and basic service implementations
- Set up the content script and background script infrastructure

## Next Steps
1. **Post Detection Implementation**:
   - Enhance the PostDetector service to reliably identify content across different websites
   - Add heuristics for different types of web content

2. **Comment UI Integration**:
   - Complete the CommentDisplay component for showing existing comments
   - Finalize the CommentFieldEnhancer for comment input
   - Ensure proper theme detection and application

3. **Background Services**:
   - Implement robust message handling between content and background scripts
   - Set up local storage for comments and preferences

4. **Testing and Refinement**:
   - Add unit and integration tests for core components
   - Test the extension on various websites

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Content Detection Strategy**: Determining the best approach for reliably identifying content posts across different websites
- **UI Integration**: How to inject the comment UI with minimal disruption to existing website layouts
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring the extension doesn't negatively impact page load and performance
- **State Management Approach**: Deciding on the optimal approach for state management across the extension
- **Error Handling Strategy**: Developing a comprehensive approach to handle various error scenarios gracefully
