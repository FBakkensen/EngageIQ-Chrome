# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
EngageIQ exists to enhance online engagement by providing a consistent commenting experience across different websites. Many websites either lack native commenting systems or have cumbersome implementations that discourage user participation. This extension aims to solve that problem by providing a unified, user-friendly commenting interface.

## Problems It Solves
- Lack of native commenting systems on many websites
- Inconsistent commenting experiences across different platforms
- Poor user interfaces that discourage engagement
- Limited functionality in existing commenting systems
- Absence of theme support for different viewing preferences
- Difficulty in tracking discussions across multiple sites

## How It Should Work
1. The extension should automatically detect content posts/articles on web pages
2. It should inject a comment section at an appropriate location (typically at the bottom of content)
3. Users should be able to read existing comments and add their own
4. Comments should be stored locally and possibly synced with a backend
5. The UI should adapt to the website's theme (light/dark mode)
6. The extension should be configurable through an options page

## User Experience Goals
- Seamless integration with existing websites
- Intuitive, clean interface that encourages participation
- Consistent experience across different websites
- Responsive design that works on various screen sizes
- Appropriate themes that match user preferences
- Minimal performance impact on website loading and interaction
- Easy configuration options for users to customize their experience
