# EngageIQ Chrome Extension - Service Documentation

This directory contains the comprehensive analysis and documentation for all services within the EngageIQ Chrome Extension. This documentation is part of the SOLID principles refactoring initiative (Step 17.1 of the development plan).

## Documentation Structure

- **[service-inventory.md](./service-inventory.md)**: Overview of all services with categorization and refactoring priorities
- **[service-inventory.json](./service-inventory.json)**: Structured data about services for programmatic use
- **Background Services**: Detailed analysis of background services in the `/background` directory
  - [ApiKeyService.md](./background/ApiKeyService.md)
  - [CommentGenerationService.md](./background/CommentGenerationService.md)
  - [UserPreferencesService.md](./background/UserPreferencesService.md)
- **Content Services**: Detailed analysis of content services in the `/content` directory
  - [CommentInserter.md](./content/CommentInserter.md)
  - [DOMObserver.md](./content/DOMObserver.md)
  - [Logger.md](./content/Logger.md)
  - [MessageHandler.md](./content/MessageHandler.md)
  - [PostDetector.md](./content/PostDetector.md)
  - [ServiceFactory.md](./content/ServiceFactory.md)
  - [ThemeDetector.md](./content/ThemeDetector.md)
- **UI Components**: Detailed analysis of UI components with service-like behavior in the `/ui` directory
  - [CommentDisplay.md](./ui/CommentDisplay.md)
  - [CommentFieldEnhancer.md](./ui/CommentFieldEnhancer.md)
- **Utility Services**: Detailed analysis of utility services in the `/utility` directory
  - [DOMUtils.md](./utility/DOMUtils.md)
  - [ErrorHandler.md](./utility/ErrorHandler.md)
- **Diagrams**: Visual representations of service relationships in the `/diagrams` directory
  - [services-architecture.md](./diagrams/services-architecture.md): Current service architecture diagram
  - [refactoring-targets.md](./diagrams/refactoring-targets.md): Before/after diagrams for key refactoring targets

## Using This Documentation

This documentation serves several purposes:

1. **Current State Analysis**: Understanding the current architecture and identifying SOLID violations
2. **Refactoring Planning**: Prioritizing services for refactoring and creating a roadmap
3. **Reference During Refactoring**: Guiding the implementation of refactoring steps
4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitoring the status of refactoring efforts

## Maintaining Documentation

The service inventory should be updated after each refactoring step to reflect the current state of the codebase. When updating:

1. Update the `lastUpdated` field in `service-inventory.json`
2. Update the `refactoringPhase` field to reflect the current phase
3. Update the status of completed refactorings
4. Add new services or interfaces as they are created
5. Update individual service documentation when changes are made

## Next Steps

With the service inventory now complete, the next steps in the refactoring process are:

1. Establish test coverage for critical services (Step 17.2)
2. Refactor core services according to the prioritized roadmap (Step 17.3)
3. Update service documentation as refactoring progresses
4. Continue to maintain the documentation of the evolving architecture

## Completion Status

âœ… Step 17.1: Service Analysis and Planning - **COMPLETED**

The service inventory is now complete with detailed documentation for all services, SOLID violation analysis, and refactoring recommendations. The foundation is set for proceeding with the implementation of test coverage (Step 17.2) and core service refactoring (Step 17.3).
