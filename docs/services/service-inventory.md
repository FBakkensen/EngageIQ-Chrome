# EngageIQ Chrome Extension - Service Inventory

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive inventory of all services within the EngageIQ Chrome Extension, their current state, relationships, and recommendations for refactoring according to SOLID principles.

## Service Categories

### Background Services
| Service | Responsibility | Interface | Priority |
|---------|----------------|-----------|----------|
| ApiKeyService | API key management | ❌ | High |
| CommentGenerationService | Generate comments using Gemini API | ❌ | High |
| UserPreferencesService | Manage user preferences | ❌ | Medium |

### Content Services
| Service | Responsibility | Interface | Priority |
|---------|----------------|-----------|----------|
| MessageHandler | Handle messages between scripts | ❌ | High |
| PostDetector | Detect LinkedIn posts | ✅ | Medium |
| DOMObserver | Observe DOM changes | ❌ | Low |
| Logger | Logging functionality | ❌ | Low |
| ServiceFactory | Service instance management | ❌ | High |
| CommentInserter | Insert comments into LinkedIn | ✅ | Medium |
| ThemeDetector | Detect theme (dark/light) | ❌ | Low |

### UI Components with Service Behavior
| Component | Responsibility | Interface | Priority |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|----------|
| CommentDisplay | Display generated comments | ✅ | High |
| CommentFieldEnhancer | Enhance comment fields | ❌ | High |

### Utility Services
| Service | Responsibility | Interface | Priority |
|---------|----------------|-----------|----------|
| DOMUtils | DOM manipulation utilities | ❌ | Low |
| ErrorHandler | Handle and log errors | ❌ | Medium |

## SOLID Violations Summary

### Single Responsibility Principle
- CommentGenerationService: Handles too many responsibilities (prompt generation, API communication, response formatting)
- CommentFieldEnhancer: Mixes UI concerns with business logic
- MessageHandler: Handles both communication and business logic

### Open/Closed Principle
- PostDetector: Hard-coded LinkedIn selectors make it difficult to extend for new post types
- ServiceFactory: Concrete implementations are tightly coupled without extension points

### Liskov Substitution Principle
- No major violations identified

### Interface Segregation Principle
- IPostDetector: Interface is too broad with unrelated methods
- Missing interfaces for most services

### Dependency Inversion Principle
- CommentInserter: Directly depends on concrete implementations rather than abstractions
- ServiceFactory: Creates concrete implementations instead of working with abstractions

## Refactoring Priorities
1. Split CommentGenerationService into smaller, focused services
2. Extract business logic from UI components
3. Create interfaces for all services
4. Implement proper dependency injection
5. Enhance ServiceFactory to support testing and customization

## Dependency Graph
[Dependency visualization to be added]

## Next Steps
1. Complete detailed analysis of each service
2. Establish test coverage baseline
3. Create detailed refactoring plan for high-priority services
4. Implement refactoring in incremental steps with continuous testing

See individual service documentation files in the corresponding directories for detailed analysis and recommendations.
